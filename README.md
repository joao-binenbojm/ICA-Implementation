# ICA-Implementation
This repository will be used to implement ICA from scratch, and test out use-cases where its assumptions hold and cases where they do not.

The implementation is based on the article "Independent component analysis: algorithms and applications" (Oja, 2000).

The demo.ipynb walks through a simple example, and explores the average estimation error vs. number of uniform distributions used as sources, which
according to the CLT, should make mixtures more and more Gaussian given more and more random sources.
